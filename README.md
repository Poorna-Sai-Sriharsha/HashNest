## ✨ Features</br>

## 🧠 How It Works</br>
- HashNest allows users to configure password criteria by selecting desired character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) and password length.</br>
- The generator ensures at least one character from each selected category is included for security.</br>
- The remaining characters are randomly selected from the chosen types, and the final password is shuffled using a Fisher-Yates algorithm to ensure unbiased randomization.</br>
- Users can copy the generated password to their clipboard with a single click, accompanied by visual feedback for a seamless experience.</br>
